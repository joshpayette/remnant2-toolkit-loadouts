# Remnant 2 Toolkit Loadouts

This repo is part of the larger [Remnant 2 Toolkit](https://github.com/joshpayette/remnant2-toolkit). This project is a separate host used primarily for parsing a `profile.sav` file and returning user loadout data for import into the Remnant 2 Toolkit.

It is no understatement to say this would not have been possible without the hard work of Andrew Savinykh, who worked on the actual parser to make the data possible, as well as creating the project this repo is based off of so that the Toolkit could leverage it.
